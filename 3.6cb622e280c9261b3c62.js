Break down functional requirements into atomic Jira tickets so to iterate fast with quick scrum cycles (1 week). Cross team planning and scrum of scrum bi-weekly meetings with all the team leaders.<br>Selected the technical stack of the new re-platforming project started in October 2016. Decided for cutting edge technologies that allow us to reduce the costs of maintainance and increase velocity. On top of react/redux we decided to manage side effects with redux-observables and RxJS because I think that functional programming is a must and need to be enforced so to reduce the amount of spaghetti-code. Codebase written in Typescript to improve the developer experience with clever Intellisense and increase velocity on refactoring time. Avoided CSS specificity problems and increased CSS maintainability, using css-in-js framework. Unit tests written in Jest/Enzyme. Backend for frontend written in Node/Express reusing react/redux stack to handle server side rendering of the homepage for SEO purpose.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="trainline">Trainline</h3>\n<p>Agile Developer<br><small>July 2015 – September 2016 | London, United Kingdom</small></p>\n<p>Full agile build process working with a continuous delivery environment. Drive direction on use of CSS and JavaScript frameworks to create a full responsive website, as well as use of appropriate testing frameworks at a JavaScript unit level (Mocha, Jasmine) and browser driven acceptance test level (CasperJS, Webdriver.io).<br>Rebranded the entire booking flow using LESS and Knockout.js in a .NET MVC environment; CasperJs acceptance tests.<br>Implemented the new payment confirmation page using pure react components.<br>Implemented a spike around the new international flow using react with inline style and redux as flux architecture. Unit tests implemented with mocha.<br>Leaded the development on the entire implementation of the new booking flow on mobile web. Used as less dependences as possible and get a first load in less then 1.5 seconds. We achieve a great goal using flexbox inline styles on react UI components, no external UI libraries. Good reusability of react components achieved by normalizing all the data on the node.js server before landing on the redux store. Functional programming and one way data flow permitted us to be agile and write completely dumb, stateless and easy to test components. Good separation of concerns thanks to proper actions creations that were dispatching only the payload needed to the reducer functions to manipulate the state. Unit tests using Mocha and browser based acceptance tests using Webdriver.io.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3 id="smartstay-inc">SmartStay, Inc</h3>\n<p>CTO<br><small>June 2014 – March 2016 (1 year 10 months)</small></p>\n<p>Implemented a web application that allows hotels to interact with its guests.

That was implemented on a web app in multiple themed chat. Two years later the game was played nationwide and my interest in doing better took me to rewrite all the code using innovation technologies and an artistic vision to develop applications: PHP5 and MySQL server side; javascript with the prototypejs framework client side. The game application has been successful and in 2006/2007 there were two hundred of users at pick in the mean time, fifteen thousand of registered users. I sell that my first project to a manager in the Padua Area to dedicate myself to the studies. During the years I always was interested to web technologies, I worked with comet server and passed to ruby languages, I tried a lot of client and server framework but only in 2010 i fall in love: I discover node.js, the innovative platform languages that permit me to create all I want in javascript.</p>\n'}}]);
